## Challenge Overview
The challenges faced were technical at times.  Getting VS Code to find our file was a bit of a challenge, but with the help of Google and our TA, we were able to termine it was a setting issue and not a coding issue.  One the setting was corrected in VS code we were good to go. Then from there the difficulty resulted from not knowing for sure where to place the code so it would provide me a full analysis.
